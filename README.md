## Ruby recursion practice:

My solutions to the [Recursion exercises](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion?ref=lnav), from the Odin Project

### fibs.rb

Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.

Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.

### merge.rb:

Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
